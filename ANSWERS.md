 Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
 the syntax and simple methods of the middleware, and it's framework for Node.js apps

 Describe Middleware?
 middleware is like a set of functions that does stuff for us... so we don't have to

 Describe a Resource?
 I don't know if this is vague on purpose or not, but a resource is something we
 can pull knowledge from, like expressjs.com.  Or it's the things we 'require' when
 creating our simple api servers...


 What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
 a message, or object with information about the request from an endpoint, or even
 the codes like 200 cool, or 404 nada

 How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
 While I'm not entirely sure how to answer this, I'd surmise that we'd create our
 api/server on it's own/separate from the rest.  And then build up a front end on
 it's own.  So it's like two apps in one.
